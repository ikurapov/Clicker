### Digitalization of Operations in Logistics

**Translation:**
Digitalization in logistics refers to the integration of advanced technologies to improve the efficiency, visibility, and overall performance of logistics operations. This transformation is driven by the need for faster, more reliable, and cost-effective supply chains. The process involves the use of cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and data analytics to streamline operations from warehousing to transportation.

**Definitions:**
1. **Cloud Computing:** Technology that allows businesses to store and access data and applications over the internet instead of on local servers.
2. **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** The simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans.
3. **Internet of Things (IoT):** A network of physical objects embedded with sensors and software to collect and exchange data.
4. **Blockchain:** A decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across many computers securely and transparently.
5. **Data Analytics:** The process of examining datasets to draw conclusions about the information they contain, often with the aid of specialized systems and software.
6. **Real-time Tracking:** Monitoring the location and status of shipments as they move through the supply chain, updated in real time.
7. **Telematics:** The integration of telecommunications and informatics to send, receive, and store information related to remote objects, such as vehicles.
8. **Digital Twins:** Virtual replicas of physical assets, processes, or systems that can be used for analysis and simulation.

**Summary:**
The digitalization of logistics operations is transforming the industry by improving efficiency, visibility, and sustainability. Traditional logistics, which relied heavily on manual processes, is being replaced by digital systems that offer end-to-end visibility and automation. Key technologies driving this change include cloud computing, AI, IoT, blockchain, and data analytics.

These technologies help in various ways:
- **Cost and Time Efficiency:** Automation of back-office operations and optimization of transportation routes reduce delays and operational costs.
- **End-to-End Visibility:** Real-time tracking and dynamic routing enhance the ability to respond to disruptions, improving customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.
- **Interoperability:** Digital systems enable better data exchange between different stakeholders, leading to more transparent and efficient operations.
- **Sustainability:** Digital tools help in reducing waste and optimizing resource usage, contributing to a lower carbon footprint.

Companies that invest in digital logistics see significant improvements in operational performance, with some achieving performance gains of 10-20% in the short term and 20-40% over a few years. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of these technologies, highlighting the need for resilient and adaptable supply chains【15†source】【16†source】【17†source】【18†source】.
